// This JS file will handle the frontend javascript on the home page
// for the remove button specifically, there will need to be an AJAX request to the backend, and upon
// successfully removing the item from the database, that entry needs to be removed from view
// edit and add buttons will redirect to the edit and add pages, but the pug layouts can make the buttons do that i think
// somehow, the AJAX request will have to send the task_id of the task being removed
